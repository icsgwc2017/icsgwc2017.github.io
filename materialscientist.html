	<h1>Material Scientist</h1>	
	<ul>
		<li>Material scientists work with wo/man-made materials and natural materials. They study the chemical properties about them. Chemical properties are when something reacts with something else. Some examples are:
Flammability (how easily materials burn) 
Baking powder and vinegar (for example, they would study how these two materials would interact when combined).
</li>
		<li>They study things like rubber, glass, clay and many more materials. Their jobs are very closely related to those of chemists. They try to improve existing materials and make them into better ones by testing out what the chemical properties are. and making them new characteristics.</li>
