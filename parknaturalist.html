	<h1>Park Naturalist</h1>
	<p>Park naturalists develop educational programs that help the environment through the collection of data (surveys, observation, interviews). This job teaches decision making, since there is often the freedom to choose your own tasks, but you will have to do face-to-face interviews and deal with weather. Bachelor's degree is what is needed to enter this job, with little or no related work experience, but some people do have a master's or doctoral/PHD working this job. This is a brand-new career, but wages can be expected at $31.27, but could get higher. Social skills are needed for this job and you have to like volunteer projects. Colombia University has good degrees in similar fields to park naturalists.</p>
